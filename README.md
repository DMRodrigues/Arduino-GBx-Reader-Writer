Introduction
------------

While searching for a way to read save games from my game boy cartridges (because you know...if the battery dies you say goodbye to save data) I didn't come across any cheap solution.

After some search I stumbled on ATmega1284p from way back when I started using Arduino and learning about AVR. I did remember this ATmega1284p (already on breadboard!!!) had [maniacbug](https://github.com/maniacbug/mighty-1284p) code to work with Arduino! Lucky me!!

Then I started reading about cartridges and how to communicate with them, destroyed an Nintendo DS to get the cartridge connector, removed the protection to be compatible with GB and GBC cartridges and it was time to code!


#### Notes

You will need an RS232 to USB converter (like the FT232R) to connect the ATmega1284p to PC.

This works with ATmega1284p (Mighty 1284P from [maniacbug](https://github.com/maniacbug/mighty-1284p)) and [MightyCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore). Use the default configurations with 16Mhz external crystal.

Compatibility
----------------------

I've developed and tested on macOS Catalina version 0.15.7 (19H2) and also tested on Debian x64 machine with GCC 8. The code should be compatible with any POSIX OS.

On Windows I recommend installing Visual Studio to compile the code or use the provided x86 executable.



Setup
------------

### Arduino
1. Follow the pinout to connect the cartridge connector to ATmega1284p
2. Connect any compatible RS232 to USB converter to pins `PD0` and `PD1`

### Windows
1. Upper right corner: __Code__ -> __Download ZIP__

### macOS & Linux

```
$ git clone git@github.com:DMRodrigues/Arduino-GBx-Reader-Writer.git
$ cd Arduino-GBx-Reader-Writer
```



How To
------------

### USB devices names
- macOS: `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` or `/dev/cu.usbserial-*`
- Linux: `/dev/ttyUSB*` or `/dev/ttyACM*` (you need to be root or in [group-mode](http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All#Permission))
- Windows: `COM*`

### Windows
1. Connect the Arduino to your PC and upload the sketch
2. Navigate to executables folder and open the command line
3. Execute the `GBx-Reader-Writer.exe` and provide the USB port
    * USB port e.g. `COM9`
4. Interact with the shell by choosing 0 - 4.

### macOS & Linux
1. Connect the Arduino to your PC and upload the sketch
2. Open the command line
3. Compile the C program with `make`
4. Execute `gbx-reader-writer` and provide the USB port
    * USB port e.g. `-p /dev/ttyUSB0`
5. Interact with the shell by choosing 0 - 4.



Examples
------------

### Windows
```
GBx-Reader-Writer.exe COM9
```

### macOS & Linux
```
./gbx-reader-writer -p /dev/ttyUSB0
```



TODO
------------

- Game Boy Advance games (WARNING: 5v from Arduino will damage the GBA cartridges that works with 3.3v)
