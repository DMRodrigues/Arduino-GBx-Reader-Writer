Introduction
------------

While searching for a way to read and write save games from my game boy cartridges (because you know...if the battery die you say goodbye to save data) I didn't come across any cheap solution.
After some search I stumbled on ATmega1284p from way back when I started using Arduino and learning about AVR. I did remember this ATmega1284p (already on breadboard!!!) had maniacbug code to work with Arduino! Lucky me!!
Then I started reading about cartridges and how to communicate with them, destroyed an Nintendo DS to get the cartridge connector, removed the protection to be compatible with DMG and CGB cartridges and it was time to code!
This works with ATmega1284p (Mighty 1284P from [maniacbug](https://github.com/maniacbug/mighty-1284p), but [MightyCore](https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore) should also be compatible!
WARNING: you need RS232 to USB converter, like the TDIFT232R, and use `PD0` and `PD1` pins.

How to
------------

1. Follow the pinout to connect the cartridge connector to ATmega1284p (don't forget the RS2323 to USB converter)
2. Connect the Arduino to your PC and upload the sketch.
3. Compile the C program with a simple `make`
4. Run the program and supply the __MINIMAL__ arguments:
    * The port name of your Arduino e.g. `-t /dev/ttyACM0`



Compatibility
----------------------
I've developed on macOS Catalina version 0.15.7 (19H2), but it should work with any POSIX compatible OS.
Porting to Windows are still ongoing.

### TTY device names
- In Mac the ports are: `/dev/cu.usbmodem14931` or `/dev/cu.usbserial-A600JW4P`
- In Linux are: `/dev/ttyACM*`, where * should be 0. (you need to be root, or be in [group-mode](http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All#Permission))



Example
------------


### Setup
```
$ git clone git@github.com:DMRodrigues/Arduino-GBx-Reader-Writer.git
$ cd Arduino-GBx-Reader-Writer
$ make
```

### Use
`./gbx-reader-writer -p /dev/cu.usbserial-A600JW4P`
Then interact with the shell by pressing any number from 0 - 4.



TODO
------------
- Keep porting the C code to Windows

- RAM write function

- Test Game Boy Advance games
